# WattKrug - The MOAB against advocacy / one-eyed science

Enclosed are two streams of analysis so far, that were presented to WG-EMM in 2021 (sic).  

1. In-depth analysis of the code, model construction and outputs from the Watters paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59223-9).  R Script "37a.R" runs and replicates the analysis, with commented in-and-out lines identifying the modifications made to reflect changes in the interpretation in how animals move etc.   This script (and others) relies on JAGS being installed, and is currently only implemented through the "jags.model" function in package "rjags", NOT package "jagsUI".  These scripts are 5 years old, and will be updated over time into a tidyverse structure.

2. The PDF file "WattKrug.pdf" is an exact copy of the paper submitted to WG-EMM.  it outlines the issues with the model construct and some of its underlying assumptions, as well as the full annotated code indicating where modifications from the original script submitted by Watters et al. 2020. 
  
3. The script "Javier_Review_Watters2020.R" is an examination of the relationships that underpin the interpretation of the model above, including the inter-relationship between krill length and season, egg weight and krill availability etc.


The goal is to submit a manuscript back into Scientific Reports and have it published prior to WG-EMM 2026. The paper will only focus on the Watters et al. 2020, given the comprehensive demolishion done on the work of Kruger et al. in successive EMM meetings.
