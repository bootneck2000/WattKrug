  \begin{abstract}
  Two independent lines of evidence have been presented to the working
  groups and SC-CAMLR that claim to demonstrate that fishery-driven
  localised depletion of krill around pygoscelid penguin colonies has had
  a deleterious effect on their performance traits and demographic trends,
  that are equivalent to the impacts of climate variation. One study
  utilises 30 years of penguin foraging and reproductive performance
  measurements collected at two colonies in the South Shetland Islands
  while the other uses demographic rate changes derived from a
  comprehensive dataset of penguin population count data across Subarea
  48.1 matched against acoustic measurements of krill biomass and krill
  catches at the gSSMU scale (Watters et al., 2020). The second uses
  estimated population trajectories across a wide range of penguin
  breeding colonies alongisde krill catches within a 30km radius (Krüger
  et al., 2021). Both studies then explore the synergistic relationships
  to measurements of broad-scale climactic variation (El Niño-Southern
  Oscillation; ENSO, and the Southern Annular Mode; SAM). Herein we
  provide a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of both approaches in
  drawing conclusions, that are now being used at the Commission level, as
  representing sound scientific advice. We demonstrate that several
  underlying assumptions in Watters et al.~2020 are contrary to the
  published scientific literature, and when the model syntax is re-written
  to reflect these, predicted penguin performance against long term
  expected means are substantially different to those presented to CCAMLR.
  The analysis provided by Krüger et al. (2021) is less sophisticated,
  however given the details provided we were unable to recreate the
  initial results and could not test the sensitivity of the model to some
  of the assumptions made. We do, however, point to areas in which we have
  concerns, and would welcome collaboration in order to clarify and
  address these through a more in-depth future analysis. Overall while our
  preliminary assessment focuses on potential issues, future work will
  centre on considering competitive interactions both at appropriate time
  and space scales between the fishery as well as between a range of krill
  dependent predators beyond just pygoscelid penguins.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Concerns over the potential impact of localised depletion of krill
through concentrated fishing effort on krill-dependent predators has
been a topic of debate within SC-CAMLR and its Working Groups for many
years. Recently, two studies have been presented that suggest that local
harvesting rates can impact predator performance to the same degree as
poor environmental conditions (Watters et al., 2020) and when poor
climactic conditions are coupled to locally high harvest rates the
synergistic impacts on predators are evident (Krüger et al., 2021).

While both studies attempt to tackle the same overall problem, they do
so using very different methodologies. Watters et al. (2020) exploit a
considerable dataset; a substantial multi-species time series of a large
number of penguin performance indices (including those collected under
CEMP) collected over three decades at two sites (Cape Shireff on
Livingstone Island and Copacabana on King George Island, South Shetland
Islands; Figure 1) and over a decade of summer acoustic krill surveys
that cover the at-sea distributions of chinstrap, gentoo and Adélie
penguins. Drawing in monthly krill catch statistics from the C1 Catch
and Effort dataset and climactic data (Oceanic Niño Index; ONI), the
authors use a hierarchical analysis of variance approach to estimate the
variance in performance indices as a function of Local Krill Biomass
(LKB), Local Harvesting Rates (LHR; the ratio of krill catch to LKB) and
ONI. In contrast, Krüger et al. (2021) utilise a broader range of
penguin colonies across the same three species throughout the Antarctic
Peninsula area, in combination with their respective abundance survey
estimates (number of occupied nests) from an open-source database
(www.penguinmap.org). The authors calculate population trends for
appropriate sites, and using the CCAMLR C1 Catch and Effort data to
extract annual catch values within a 30km radius of each colony.
Finally, Krüger et al. (2021) use the sign of the difference in the
number of nests between annual surveys as a response in a binomial
generalised linear mixed effects model using the accumulated annual
catch and the mean wintertime Southern Annular Mode (SAM) to determine
the relative contributions of each predictor and their interactive
effects on population abundance trends. Both studies draw similar
conclusions; that local harvesting levels of krill impact predators, and
the degree of impact can either be similar to that of poor environmental
conditions or have a synergistic impact when high local harvesting
coincides with poor conditions.

These conclusions have been propagated into Commission documentation
supporting the reformulation of the D1MPA proposal (CCAMLR-39/BG/02) as
well as into Commission discussions (CCAMLR-39, Para 5.48 \& Para 5.51).
However, while the two studies have moved from Working Papers of EMM
into the realm of the peer-reviewed literature, there are some areas of
concern regarding the structuring of these studies that we think deserve
attention. Some of these concerns are unique to each study while others
are common across both, and we structure our paper accordingly. Firstly,
we review Watters et al. (2020) and Krüger et al. (2021) through the
lens of some of the ecological assumptions made versus the available
evidence pertaining to them. Within the constraints of the data and
analytical methods that are available from the studies, we also quantify
how rationalising these assumptions to the evidence available impacts on
the conclusions drawn. We then highlight some overarching concerns
applicable to both papers.

\section{Watters et al. (2020) / WG-EMM
2019/11}\label{watters2020-wg-emm-201911}}

A key goal for the paper is to highlight the mismatch between the areal
scales of fisheries management and ecological interactions between
fishing extractions and dependent predators. To do this, the authors
create two strata aligned with groups of SSMU (gSSMU); gSSMU \#1
including those SSMU inside the Bransfield Strait (APBSE and APBSW) and
gSSMU \#2 incorporating SSMU north of the South Shetlands, including
Elephant Island (APDPE, APDPW and APEI) represented in Figure 1. These
gSSMU cover \(15,500nm^2\) and \(20,600nm^2\), respectively, and are
used to characterise both krill biomass and harvesting rates that are
``local'' to the penguin colonies for which performance data are used.
The reasoning behind scaling to gSSMU are linked to the foraging
behaviour of the penguins for which performance data area available
i.e.~breeding, adult pygoscelids. The authors cite Hinke et al. (2017)
as the evidence supporting usage of the two gSSMU as appropriate strata.

Pygoscelid penguins exhibit staggered breeding, with Adélies commencing
first, followed by chinstraps then gentoos (Black, 2016). Adélie
penguins are the first to fledge their chicks and thus cease to be
centrally foraging, typically departing mid-February for their moulting
grounds on the sea ice. chinstrap penguins depart for a pre-moult
foraging trip towards the end of February and return to land in order to
moult, before departing again for their overwinter trip (Hinke et al.,
2015, 2019)(Figure 2). Conversely, gentoo penguins appear to remain in
close proximity to their breeding colonies overwinter (Korczak-Abshire
et al., 2021).

We use the Argos-CLS PTT telemetry data provided by the supporting
studies to characterise the actual at-sea habitat used, in the context
of the relative stage of breeding for each species (though we also
recommend Warwick-Evans et al. (2018) and Lowther et al.~(this meeting)
amongst other work, for further quantification of foraging behaviour of
breeding penguins in this area). For each species, we refrain from
undertaking extensive state-space modelling of location errors and
merely exclude locations with a ``Z'' error class, accepting the
remaining locations had varying degrees of uncertainty around them, then
calculated the 99\% Minimum Convex Polygon (home range) using the R
package \emph{adehabitatHR} and calculate their associated areas in
\(nm^2\). For chinstrap penguins at Cape Shireff, this equated to a home
range area of \textasciitilde{}\(4,782nm^2\), or only 23\% of the gSSMU
to which their performance metrics are indexed against (Watters et al.,
2020). For the same species at Copacabana the 99\% MCP home range is
2,905\(nm^2\), or \textasciitilde19\% of gSSMU 1 in the Bransfield
Strait. Similarly for Adélie penguins, the breeding foraging range
occupied 1,139\(nm^2\) or only \textasciitilde7\% of the area of gSSMU
\#1. After breeding, available overwinter PTT telemetry and light
geolocating data on chinstrap and Adélie penguins suggests a wide
dispersal westwards into the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, and
eastwards into the Weddell Sea and Atlantic sectors, with a relatively
small proportion of chinstraps from the study sites remaining within
500km of their breeding colonies (Hinke et al., 2019). Yet despite the
evidence supporting widescale post-breeding migration of both Adélie and
chinstrap penguins, the model used by Watters et al. (2020) constrains
both species from Copacabana to gSSMU \#1 and chinstraps from Cape
Shireff to gSSMU \#2 over winter (Supplementary Material 1 \& 2, code
lines 258 to 279). This has the effect of constraining the variability
in performance indices from these species to LHR, LKB and ONI over
winter in areas where the species has a demonstrated tendency to migrate
away from (Figure 2). This is particularly important given that the
fishery can now be characterised with a late autumn/early winter start
which places a seasonal element on LHR towards increased values in the
winter (Figure 5).

Our preliminary review thus far raises two areas of concern. Firstly,
that the scales at which ``local'' predictors are summarised are in some
cases almost 15 times larger than the habitat exploited by the penguins
monitored. Local Harvest Rate is a function of the catch and its
distribution; we demonstrate catch distribution varies across breeding
seasons within the original gSSMU, using available C1 Catch and Effort
data during the austral summer period, relevant to the breeding season
and thus centrally foraging Adélie and chinstrap penguins between 2009
and 2018 for Subarea 48.1 (Figure S1).

Secondly, that the known overwinter migratory behaviour of Adélie and
chinstrap penguins are poorly reflected in the model formulation. To
demonstrate the impact that these ecological assumptions have on the
model output, we rerun the model of Watters et al. (2020) with modified
code. To avoid an overly burdensome paper, we shortly summarise those
code changes here, and if requested during the meeting we are happy to
include the rmarkdown version of this paper with the modified code in
place, or submit the modifications to the meeting in some other format.

We also note an additional coding error that may influence how the
original, unmodified results are interpreted. In summarising the model
outputs into boxplots, the code relating to developing the original
manuscript Figure 2 (Supplementary Material 1, lines 661-663) seemingly
classifies the ``Worst Case'' with ``neutral'' ONI (\({-0.5}\)
\(^{\circ}\)C \textless{} ONI \textless{} 0.5 \(^{\circ}\)C; LKB
\textgreater{} 1 Mt; and LHR \(\geqslant\) 0.1) using Parameter set 36
from the output dataframe, which actually reflects a ``warm'' ONI
component (\textgreater{} 0.5 \(^{\circ}\)C; LKB \textgreater{} 1 Mt;
and LHR \(\geqslant\) 0.1). Yet the discussion in Watters et al. (2020)
suggests that the likelihood of their ``Worst Case'' includes future
warming (see Figure 3 below)

We agree that any ``Worst Case'' should reflect ENSO conditions into the
future under a warming climate. However, climate change is likely to
increase ENSO in amplitude - both El Niño (ONI ``warm'') and La Niña
(ONI ``cold'') (Capotondi et al., 2015). How this increasing amplitude
can be integrated appropriately into the presented modelling framework
to match with long-term predicted mean performance of predators has not
been explored yet. As such, and for the sake of comparison with the
original study, we maintain the authors designation of ONI ``neutral''
when rendering the ``Worst Case'' boxplots, though caution that this is
unlikely to be a realistic expectation.

\hypertarget{modifications}{%
\subsection{Modifications}\label{modifications}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We scale the gSSMU LKB to the SSMU that the summer tracking data
  indicate penguins occupied. To do this, we calculate the area
  (\(nm^2\)) of the SSMU for which the predator occupies and the gSSMU
  to which it is assigned, then create a scaling ratio. For example, we
  scale LKB for Cape Shireff chinstrap penguins solely to ADPDW (Figure
  1) by multiplying the gSSMU LKB by the areal ratio of ADPDW/gSSMU \#2.
  We then select the corresponding SSMU catch values provided in Watters
  et al. (2020) (Supplementary Info) to estimate SSMU-scale LHR. We also
  caution that while considering the gSSMU scale of harvesting as
  inappropriate for ``local'' effects, even the SSMU-scale catch levels
  likely do not reflect pressures at scales relevant to breeding
  penguins (Supplementary Figure 1).\\
\item
  We remove Adélie and chinstrap penguins from the model formulation
  over winter; that is, we attribute each species as ``NA'' during
  winter (to account for dispersal after breeding), thus removing them
  from association with any gSSMU.\\
\item
  The authors place LKB/LHR values in March into the ``summer'' period.
  However fishing effort over the period that performance indices are
  available is not uniform over the thirty year period, with catch over
  the preceding decade tending towards a nonlinear increase from the
  middle of March and three years where catch rates increased rapidly
  from the beginning of the month (Figure 4). Given the highly variable
  rates of catch throughout the study period, we run scenarios that
  classify March as either summer or winter to reflect the linkage
  between March and the breeding state of penguins i.e.~Adélie and
  chinstrap penguins have either migrated out of the area or have ceased
  to be centrally foraging species by March.
\end{enumerate}

Thus we reformulate the underlying assumptions above into a new model
construct, in which performance indices from all three species during
the summer are included, but Adélie and chinstrap penguins cease to be
centrally foraging species after breeding and migrate out of the area.
The performance indices are matched in space and time but using SSMU
level estimates of LKB and LHR. We re-run this reformulation using the
original analysis of variance model framework that includes imputed
values for LKB in years where survey data are missing. We further
consider two alternatives for considering March, either in a) summer or
b) winter.

We present the outputs both in the same boxplot format as Figure 2 in
the original manuscript, and as individual cases grouped and
colour-coded as ONI ``warm'' (\(\geqslant\) 0.5; red), ONI ``neutral''
(-0.5 \textless{} ONI \textgreater{} +0.5; white) and ONI ``cold''
(\textless{} -0.5; blue). We also recreate the original marginal
probabilities in Table 1 of Watters et al. (2020), and two additional
tables in the same format with the probabilities extracted from our
reformulated model, the difference between the latter two tables
reflecting whether March is in summer or winter.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

From the original Watters et al. (2020) model, the probability that the
Worst Case would cause penguin performance indices to drop below their
long-term mean was 77\%, while relative to the Best Case there was a
93\% probability that penguin performance would decline as a response to
high LHR. Similarly, there was a 99\% probability that high LHR and LKB
under neutral ONI (``Worst Case'', though see above for comments on
this) would drive penguin peformance to fall below its long term mean
(Table 1).

Our reformulation paints a very different picture, and while we refrain
from providing an exhaustive in-text comparison, we highlight a few
examples here. Comparing the original model outputs with ours, relative
to the Best Case, the probability of negative impacts to penguins due to
high LHR dropped precipitously from \(\geqslant\) 93\% to 37\% (Table
3). In other words, considering the migration of penguins in accordance
with their known ecology (Figure 2), the relative probability of
negative impact of LHR drops from a near-certainty to 1-in-3 (Table 2
and 3). Given the temporal separation between fishing and penguin
breeding over the preceding decade, our results are unsurprising.

The probability that the effects of warm or neutral ONI would be more
detrimental to penguin performance were greater than for the Worst Case
(Table 2 and 3). When we consider the marginal effects of neutral ONI
and high LHR, the probabilities that the former would negatively impact
penguin performance below the long-term mean was x4 greater than the
impact of high LHR (Table 2 and 3). Looking at the case-by-case and
selected plots in Figure 4 the overwhelming dominace of the ONI state
can clearly be seen. La Niña (``cold'' ONI) conditions resulted in
predictive probabilities of performance that were equal to, or
surpassing, those of the Best Case irrespective of increased LKB or LHR.
Even more bizarrely, an increase in LHR to even high levels has a lower
probability of decreasing penguin performance than that of the Best Case
(Table 2 and 3). However, it is important to note that overall our
intention is not to suggest that increased fishing is beneficial; merely
that when the model is reconditioned on ecological knowledge, the
outputs in its current formulation should be treated with caution.

The authors contend that they have little doubt that penguins are
responding to both the environment and fishing; we contend that they are
reacting to the environment, and the scales at which their model
incorporates fishing bear no relevance to the scales at which penguins
exploit (Figure S1). The authors of the original model also identify an
insensitivity of penguin performance to marginal changes in LKB as
corroborating previous failed attempts to parameterise functional
responses of penguins - we fully agree as our reanalysis draws similar
conclusions of insensitivity, but we propose that even the SSMU scale is
inappropriate for matching food availability and harvesting pressure to
predator performance (Figure S1).

In light of this, and the scales of management originally proposed by us
in WG-EMM 2019/18, we support the direction of discussions during
WG-ASAM this year to consider spatial scales of management to areas in
which the fishery operates, rather than at the Subarea level.

\hypertarget{kruger2021-wg-emm-201910}{%
\section{Krüger et al. (2021) / WG-EMM
2019/10}\label{kruger2021-wg-emm-201910}}

The key objective of the paper by Krüger et al. (2021) is to examine the
potential synergistic effects of climate change and increased fishing
activity in recent decades on the breeding performance of chinstrap and
gentoo penguins. The authors make the implicit assumption that there has
been a general decrease in krill density in response to climate change,
although this is still a topic of debate and is not supported by recent
large-scale surveys in the Scotia Sea (SG-ASAM 2019/08 Rev.1).

To address this topic, the authors fit a Generalized Linear Mixed
Effects model of the general form:
\[\lambda=catch*SAM+(1|colony\text{ }ID)\] where \(\lambda\) is an index
of change in penguin breeding performance, \(catch\) is annual krill
catch, \(SAM\) is the Southern Annular Mode index, and the term in
brackets indicate a random intercept term by colony. We would like to
discuss some points regarding both the model formulation and the input
data that we believe raise some potential concerns about the overall
approach and the conclusions drawn. Based on the issues we raise here,
we would welcome the opportunity to collaborate openly on a) recreating
these analyses b) testing their sensitivity to the assumptions made and
c) develop alternative approaches to alleviate these issues and provide
a more reliable result. Below we go through these issues in some detail.
Unlike in the case of Watters et al. (2020), scripts are not provided
for the analyses done by Krüger et al. (2021), and therefore we have not
been able to recreate their analyses or test various aspects of data
input, underlying assumptions and alternative model formulations.
Additionally, there appear to be some discrepancies between the data
provided in the supplementary material and what was actually used in the
paper.

\hypertarget{response-variable-penguin-breeding-performance}{%
\subsection{Response variable: Penguin breeding
performance}\label{response-variable-penguin-breeding-performance}}

As the basis for the index of change in breeding performance
(\(\lambda\)), Krüger et al. (2021) use data on the number of occupied
nests (breeding pairs) counted at a large number of sites throughout the
Antarctic Peninsula collected between 1980 and 2017. These data are
available from the Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and
Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD) data archive (www.penguinmap.com; Humphries
et al. (2017)). Krüger et al. (2021) include count data on occupied
nests based on surveys carried out in November or December, reflecting
the early breeding season. They further subset the data to include only
colonies for which at least 2 survey estimates are available throughout
the 38-year period under consideration (i.e.~1980-2017). These data are
provided in the supplementary materials for the paper. Based on the raw
counts, they calculate an index of temporal variation in population
growth rate using: \[\lambda_{std}=((n_b/n_a)/years_{b-a}-1\] where
\(n\) is the number of breeding pairs counted in Nov-Dec of a given
year, \(b\) and the number of breeding pairs counted in the nearest
previous year, \(a\), in which a Nov-Dec survey was conducted, divided
by the interval between surveys (i.e.~\(b-a\)). While this index may be
a robust index of relative population change, the authors then convert
\(\lambda_{std}\) into a binary index, \(bin\lambda_{std}\) that takes
the value 1 for negative growth and 0 for positive growth. The rationale
is that this value can be interpreted as the probability of population
decline in response to catch and environmental change. However by only
taking the sign of the change and creating a binary response the authors
completely ignore the magnitude of the absolute or relative change in
population size; that is, a decline of 1\% or 99\% of the population
size in year \(a\) is considered equivalent in the model.

\hypertarget{predictor-variables-krill-catch-and-sam}{%
\subsection{Predictor variables: Krill catch and
SAM}\label{predictor-variables-krill-catch-and-sam}}

As in the case of Watters et al. (2020), Krüger et al. (2021) also use
CCAMLR C1 Catch and Effort data from the krill fishery to estimate
fishing pressure, but in this case only hauls within a 30km radius are
considered for each specific colony. This selection is based on previous
observations that foraging of pygoscelid penguins is more probable
within 30 km of the colonies during the breeding season (Warwick-Evans
et al., 2018). While they initially summarise these data within distinct
time periods (reflecting different important stages of the penguin
annual cycle), these are only used for illustrative purposes (Fig 3 in
Krüger et al., 2021). When modelling the effect of fisheries on
population response, the authors instead use accumulated annual catches
within these 30km areas, making the assumption that the number of
breeding penguins counted in a given survey is affected by local
resource availability, also during the non-breeding period in winter.
While this might be valid for gentoo penguins which appear to remain
close to the breeding colonies also outside the breeding season
(Korczak-Abshire et al., 2021), it is questionable how appropriate this
is for chinstraps that have displayed tendencies to disperse much more
widely during winter (see above section and references therein). An
additional issue with the spatial restriction of catch data is that a
high proportion of surveys are associated with accumulated annual catch
rates = 0. While this may not pose a serious problem for chinstraps
(79\% of colonies have had some level of catch within their 30km radius)
the problem may be quite serious for gentoos (51\% of colonies had catch
within a 30km radius).

The authors use monthly data on the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index to
represent environmental variability (Doddridge and Marshall, 2017; Kwok
and Comiso, 2002). Based on an observed 0-3 month lagged correlation
between SAM and relevant local climate variables (fractional sea ice
cover, open water sensible heat flux and sea level air pressure), the
authors exclude SAM values for months coinciding with the breeding
season. As discussed in the review of Watters et al. (2020) above, the
climactic conditions over the WAP are a function primarily of the
Amundsen Sea Low and its interactions with both ENSO and SAM, as well as
the bathymetry of the local areas. There is a rich scientific literature
addressing climate-driven hydrographic variability in the WAP , none of
which is considered in this paper.

\hypertarget{spatio-temporal-mismatch}{%
\subsection{Spatio-temporal mismatch}\label{spatio-temporal-mismatch}}

While the above sections describe some of our specific concerns with the
various input data to the GLME, our main concern relates to issues of
mismatch between these various data in space and time. Given the
different data selections and transformations, the specific model
specification presented in Krüger et al. (2021) is:
\[bin\lambda_{std}=catch_y*SAM+(1|colony\text{ }ID)\] where the
subscript \(y\) denotes the accumulated krill catch within 30km of each
colony over the year last survey in a survey interval (i.e.~year \(b\)
using the notation in the performance equation above). Similarly, the
SAM index is the mean SAM index over almost the same period, but
excluding the three months of the breeding season itself. To clarify
this, we change the subscripts in the model equation:

\[bin\lambda_{std_I}=\sum_{i=0}^{i=12}{catch_i}*\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{i=8}{SAM_i}}{9}+(1|colony\text{ }ID)\]

Here, \(I\) represents the survey interval, expressed in months rather
than years, while \(i\) represents the number of months prior to the
start of the survey carried out in the last year of the interval \(I\).
While \(i\) is always \(\leqslant\) 12, \(I\) is always \(\geqslant\)
12. In fact, based on the Krüger et al. (2021) supplementary dataset,
\(I>12\) in \textasciitilde{} 26\% and 47\% of all intervals for
Chinstraps and Gentoos respectively (Figure 5). This illustrates the
substantial and increasing issue of temporal mismatch between the
response variable and the explanatory variables with increasing \(I\).
As \(I\) increases, the difference in the number of breeding pairs
between the first and last year of an interval will increasingly be a
function of the catch rates and environmental conditions in ALL years in
the interval, not just the final year. In the extreme case, it is highly
unlikely that an overall decrease in breeding population size of
Chinstraps at Penguin Island between 1980 and 2000 is in large part a
response of local catch rates and SAM index in the single year preceding
the 2000 breeding season survey. In addition, with increasing \(I\), the
probability that a change in number of breeding pairs has been
monotonous and linear throughout the entire interval becomes less
likely, and the probability decreases that \(bin\lambda_{std_I}\) has
the same sign as the actual (unobserved) change between the last two
breeding seasons in the interval.

\subsection{Possible tests and alternative modelling
approaches}\label{possible-tests-and-alternative-modelling-approaches}}

To address the issues raised above, the analyses of Krüger et al. (2021)
should be re-run with e.g.~random subsets of the data or with data
substitutions/permutations of the survey estimates. For instance,
additional simulated surveys could be inserted into intervals \(I>12\),
specifically such that it changes the monotonous trend over the interval
to change the sign of the associated \(bin\lambda_{std_I}\).
Additionally, the 30km radius for catch rates could be relaxed, at least
for months outside of the breeding period, when especially chinstraps
are known to disperse widely throughout the wider West Antarctic shelf
regions (see Fig. 2).

In general, we strongly argue that the spatio-temporal mismatch between
the various input data must be explicitly accounted for in some way. One
relatively simple approach would be to relax the temporal restriction of
covariate data, such that catch rates and SAM values for all
years/months within an interval between surveys are combined, rather
than only using values from within the last year before the next survey.
However, the most appropriate general strategy would be to include an
approach for estimating spatio-temporal autocorrelation structures in
the data, and exploiting these structures explicitly in the modelling.
For instance, colonies closer together could ``borrow strength'' from
each-other in cases of long intervals between consecutive surveys at
some colonies, especially for survey estimates of breeding population
size. Additional consideration of lagged recruitment (fledging to
reproductive age) is also needed, alongside the ability of the ability
to detect it given irregular surveying effort and methods for
longitudinal detection (such as banding or other permanent marking). We
would very much welcome the opportunity to discuss various options for
such approaches directly with the authors.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Our preliminary review of the evidence supporting localised effects of
fishing coupled with broad-scale climactic phenomena having an impact on
the vital statistics of pygoscelid penguins (performance and demographic
trends) are based on assumptions that potentially do not reflect current
knowledge of penguin breeding phenology and movement.

Of greatest concern, however, is that the interpretation of model
outputs from both approaches (either from both the original studies or
the modified parameters we describe) are under boundary conditions that
we feel are not appropriate. Both approaches consider only the fishery
and broad-scale climate phenomena as the only two causes of krill
abundance variability at geographic scales relevant to penguins. Neither
study considers, for example, the impact of rebounding baleen whale
populations or migratory male Antarctic fur seals beyond brief
mentioning. Humpback whales have increased in abundance throughout the
life of the krill fishery, and there are sufficient telemetry and
distance sampling studies in the scientific literature to demonstrate
the degree and significance of spatiotemporal overlap with breeding
penguin populations (see Santora and Veit (2013), Lowther et al. (2020),
Oosthuizen et al., Johannessen et al., Lowther et al.~submitted to this
meeting, and Figure S2 as examples). Importantly, the distribution of
these and numerous other unconsidered competitors is not uniform in
either space or time, and their impact on local availability of krill is
likely to be considerable. It is also worth noting that neither study
considers the impact of climate on the terrestrial breeding grounds,
such as chick mortality through ``wetting down'' by increased rainfall
(Chapman et al., 2011).

Similarly, the utilisation of broad-scale climatological phenomena to
characterise impacts at scales that predators are dependent upon is
problematic. The Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is the dominant climate feature
for the western Antarctic Peninsula. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation
modulates the ASL, with El Niño (La Niña) shallowing (deepening) its
pressure, causing more northwesterly (southeasterly) winds and upwelling
(restricted influx) of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the shelf. The
Southern Annular Mode also influences the pressure of the ASL, with the
current trend of negative SAM constructively (destructively) interfering
with ASL when in phase with El Niño (La Niña) events (e.g.~Clem et al.
(2016)). The result is a set of above-surface climate conditions that
drive changes in water mass intrusion that is in turn dependent on
\emph{interactions} between two climate processes. The bathymetry of the
Antarctic Peninsula which also influences the hydrographic conditions is
complex (particularly at scales that are important to centrally-foraging
predators such as penguins) and the structuring of krill aggregations in
time and space in the WAP have been linked to mesoscale circulation
processes (Santora et al., 2012), which are unlikely to be uniformly
affected by macroscale processes.

Our work into the future will progress along three lines, and we welcome
any and all offers of collaboration into this work. Firstly, we will
progress this debate into the scientific literature in order to ensure a
balanced discussion occurs in that forum. Secondly, we will be examining
in further detail some of the additional predictors used and their
efficacy, the modelling frameworks into which they are brought, and how
their incorporation influences the interpretation of the responses.
Finally, we shall also be exploring alternative modelling approaches
that reflect more of the physical and biological complexity of the
system in question. In all cases, our goal is to ensure that the best
available objective scientific evidence is presented to our
environmental managers and, where appropriate, flag that disagreement
exists. Our paper is intended to be viewed in this light to generate
constructive dialogue that addresses our common concern of the potential
for localised fishing to impact dependent aspects of the ecosystem.
