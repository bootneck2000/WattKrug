  \begin{abstract}
  Two independent lines of evidence have been presented to the working
  groups and SC-CAMLR that claim to demonstrate that fishery-driven
  localised depletion of krill around pygoscelid penguin colonies has
  had a deleterious effect on their performance traits and demographic
  trends, that are equivalent to the impacts of climate variation. One
  study utilises 30 years of penguin foraging and reproductive
  performance of penguins in relation to krill biomass using 30 years of
  data collected at two colonies in the South Shetland Islands, whereas
  the other uses demographic rate changes derived from a comprehensive
  dataset of penguin population count data across Subarea 48.1 matched
  against acoustic measurements of krill biomass and krill catches at
  the gSSMU scale \citep{Watters2020}. The second uses estimated
  population trajectories across a wide range of penguin breeding
  colonies in relation to krill catches within a 30km radius
  \citep{Kruger2021}. Both studies then explore the synergistic
  relationships to measurements of broad-scale climactic variation (El
  Niño-Southern Oscillation; ENSO, and the Southern Annular Mode; SAM).
  Herein we provide a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of both
  approaches in drawing conclusions, that are now being used at the
  Commission level, as representing sound scientific advice. We
  demonstrate that several underlying assumptions in Watters et al.~2020
  are contrary to the published scientific literature, and when the
  model syntax is re-written to reflect these, predicted penguin
  performance against long term expected means are substantially
  different to those presented to CCAMLR. The evidence provided by
  \citet{Kruger2021} uses a different analytical approach, however given
  the details provided we were unable to recreate the initial results
  and could not test the sensitivity of the model to some of the
  assumptions made. We do, however, point to areas in which we have
  concerns, and would welcome collaboration in order to clarify and
  address these through a more in-depth future analysis. Overall while
  our preliminary assessment focuses on potential issues, future work
  will centre on considering competitive interactions both at
  appropriate time and space scales between the fishery as well as
  between a range of krill dependent predators beyond just pygoscelid
  penguins.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Concerns over the potential impact of localised depletion of krill
through concentrated fishing effort on krill-dependent predators has
been a topic of debate within the Antarctic science community for many
years. Recently, one study has been presented that suggest that local
harvesting rates can impact predator performance to the same degree as
poor environmental conditions \citep{Watters2020} by matching various
performance indices of krill-dependent penguins relative to estimates of
krill biomass, fishing pressure and broad scale climate variability. The
penguin performance indices were collected at two sites (Cape Shireff on
Livingstone Island and Copacabana on King George Island, South Shetland
Islands; Figure 1) in the period 1982 - 2016 whereas krill abundance
data, which cover the at-sea distributions of chinstrap, gentoo and
Adélie penguins, were collected during summer (1996 - 2011) and winter
(2012, 2014 and 2015). By drawing in monthly krill catches from Catch
and Effort data reported to CCAMLR and climate data (ONI), the authors
use a hierarchical analysis of variance approach to estimate the
variance in these indices as a function of Local Krill Biomass (LKB),
Local Harvesting Rates (LHR; the ratio of krill catch to LKB) and the
Oceanic Niño Index (ONI). The study drew the conclusion that local
harvesting levels of krill adversely impact penguins, and the degree of
impact can either be similar to that of poor environmental conditions or
have a synergistic impact when high local harvesting coincides with poor
conditions.

The conclusions of this paper, which at the time of writing has
accumulated 162 citations, have been used by CCAMLR in support of
developing Marine Protected Area proposals and fisheries management
strategies as well as being used in the review process of the Marine
Stewardship Council fisheries certification process for Antarctic krill.
In other words, the study has been propagated into geopolitical and
socioeconomic environments that are having real-world impacts beyond
scientific debate. However, there are several areas of concern regarding
the structuring of this study that deserve attention. Firstly, we review
\citet{Watters2020} through the lens of the ecological assumptions
underpinning the study conclusions, versus the available evidence
supporting them. Secondly, we quantitatively assess how rationalising
these assumptions to the evidence available changes the model outputs
and on the conclusions drawn. We then highlight some overarching
concerns applicable to the paper.

Mismatched scales of predator monitoring and fisheries management

A key goal for the paper is to highlight the consequences of mismatching
scales at which the Antarctic krill fishery is managed with the scales
at which ecological interactions between fishing extractions and
dependent predators occur. To do this, they create two strata aligned
with groups of SSMU (gSSMU); gSSMU \#1 including those SSMU inside the
Bransfield Strait (APBSE and APBSW) and gSSMU \#2 incorporating SSMU
north of the South Shetlands, including Elephant Island (APDPE, APDPW
and APEI) represented in Figure 1. These gSSMU cover \(15,500nm^2\) and
\(20,600nm^2\), respectively, and are used to characterise both krill
biomass and harvesting rates that are ``local'' to the penguin colonies
for which performance data are used. The reasoning behind scaling to
gSSMU are linked to the foraging behaviour of the penguins for which
performance data area available i.e.~breeding, adult pygoscelids. The
authors cite \citet{Hinke2017} as the evidence supporting usage of the
two gSSMU as appropriate strata.

Pygoscelid penguins exhibit staggered breeding, with Adélies commencing
first, followed by chinstraps then gentoos \citep{Black2016}. Adélie
penguins are the first to fledge their chicks and thus cease to be
centrally foraging, typically departing mid-February for their moulting
grounds on the sea ice. chinstrap penguins depart for a pre-moult
foraging trip towards the end of February and return to land in order to
moult, before departing again for their overwinter trip
\citet{Hinke2015}; \citet{Hinke2019}. Conversely, gentoo penguins appear
to remain near their breeding colonies overwinter
\citep{korczak-abshireCoastalRegionsNorthern2021}.

We use the Argos-CLS PTT telemetry data provided by the supporting
studies to characterise the actual at-sea habitat used, in the context
of the relative stage of breeding for each species (though we also
recommend \citet{Warwick-Evans2018} and Lowther et al.~(this meeting)
amongst other work, for further quantification of foraging behaviour of
breeding penguins in this area). For each species, we refrain from
undertaking extensive state-space modelling of location errors and
merely exclude locations with a ``Z'' error class, accepting the
remaining locations had varying degrees of uncertainty around them, then
calculated the 99\% Minimum Convex Polygon (home range) using the R
package adehabitatHR and calculate their associated areas in \(nm^2\).
For chinstrap penguins at Cape Shireff, this equated to a home range
area of \textasciitilde{}\(4,782nm^2\), or only 23\% of the gSSMU to
which their performance metrics are indexed against \citep{Watters2020}.
For the same species at Copacabana the 99\% MCP home range is
2,905\(nm^2\), or \textasciitilde19\% of gSSMU 1 in the Bransfield
Strait. Similarly for Adélie penguins, the breeding foraging range
occupied 1,139\(nm^2\) or only \textasciitilde7\% of the area of gSSMU
\#1. After breeding, available overwinter PTT telemetry and light
geolocating data on chinstrap and Adélie penguins suggests a wide
dispersal westwards into the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, and
eastwards into the Weddell Sea and Atlantic sectors, with a relatively
small proportion of chinstraps from the study sites remaining within
500km of their breeding colonies \citep{Hinke2019}. Yet despite the
evidence supporting widescale post-breeding migration of both Adélie and
chinstrap penguins, the model used by \citet{Watters2020} constrains
both species from Copacabana to gSSMU \#1 and chinstraps from Cape
Shireff to gSSMU \#2 over winter (Supplementary Material 1 \& 2, code
lines 258 to 279). This has the effect of constraining the variability
in performance indices from these species to LHR, LKB and ONI over
winter in areas where the species has a demonstrated tendency to migrate
away from (Figure 2). This is particularly important given that the
fishery can now be characterised with a late autumn/early winter start
which places a seasonal element on LHR towards increased values in the
winter (Figure 5).

Our preliminary review thus far raises two areas of concern. Firstly,
that the scales at which ``local'' predictors are summarised are in some
cases almost 15 times larger than the habitat exploited by the penguins
monitored. Local Harvest Rate is a function of the catch and its
distribution; we demonstrate catch distribution varies across breeding
seasons within the original gSSMU, using available C1 Catch and Effort
data during the austral summer period, relevant to the breeding season
and thus centrally foraging Adélie and chinstrap penguins between 2009
and 2018 for Subarea 48.1 (Figure S1).

Secondly, that the known overwinter migratory behaviour of Adélie and
chinstrap penguins are poorly reflected in the model formulation. To
demonstrate the impact that these ecological assumptions have on the
model output, we rerun the model of \citet{Watters2020} with modified
code. To avoid an overly burdensome paper, we shortly summarise those
code changes here, and if requested during the meeting we are happy to
include the rmarkdown version of this paper with the modified code in
place, or submit the modifications to the meeting in some other format.

We also note an additional coding error that may influence how the
original, unmodified results are interpreted. In summarising the model
outputs into boxplots, the text in the paper seemingly classifies the
``Worst Case'' with ``neutral'' ONI (\({-0.5}\) \(^{\circ}\)C
\textless{} ONI \textless{} 0.5 \(^{\circ}\)C; LKB \textgreater{} 1 Mt;
and LHR \(\geqslant\) 0.1) and the code relating to developing the
original manuscript Figure 2 (Supplementary Material 1, lines 661-663)
uses Parameter set 36 from the output dataframe, which actually reflects
a ``warm'' ONI component (\textgreater{} 0.5 \(^{\circ}\)C; LKB
\textgreater{} 1 Mt; and LHR \(\geqslant\) 0.1). Yet the discussion in
\citet{Watters2020} also suggests that the likelihood of their ``Worst
Case'' includes future warming (see Figure 3 below)

We agree that any ``Worst Case'' should reflect ENSO conditions into the
future under a warming climate. However, climate change is likely to
increase ENSO in amplitude - both El Niño (ONI ``warm'') and La Niña
(ONI ``cold'') \citep{capotondiUnderstandingENSODiversity2015}. How this
increasing amplitude can be integrated appropriately into the presented
modelling framework to match with long-term predicted mean performance
of predators has not been explored yet. As such, and for the sake of
comparison with the original study, we maintain the authors designation
of ONI ``neutral'' when rendering the ``Worst Case'' boxplots, though
caution that this is unlikely to be a realistic assumption

\subsection{Modifications}\label{modifications}

We scale the gSSMU LKB to the SSMU that the summer tracking data
indicate penguins occupied. To do this, we calculate the area (\(nm^2\))
of the SSMU for which the predator occupies and the gSSMU to which it is
assigned, then create a scaling ratio. For example, we scale LKB for
Cape Shireff chinstrap penguins solely to ADPDW (Figure 1) by
multiplying the gSSMU LKB by the areal ratio of ADPDW/gSSMU \#2. We then
select the corresponding SSMU catch values provided in
\citet{Watters2020} (Supplementary Info) to estimate SSMU-scale LHR. We
also caution that while considering the gSSMU scale of harvesting as
inappropriate for ``local'' effects, even the SSMU-scale catch levels
likely do not reflect pressures at scales relevant to breeding penguins
(Supplementary Figure 1).

We remove Adélie and chinstrap penguins from the model formulation over
winter; that is, we attribute each species as ``NA'' during winter (to
account for dispersal after breeding), thus removing them from
association with any gSSMU.

The authors place LKB/LHR values in March into the ``summer'' period.
However fishing effort over the period that performance indices are
available is not uniform over the thirty year period, with catch over
the preceding decade tending towards a nonlinear increase from the
middle of March and three years where catch rates increased rapidly from
the beginning of the month (Figure 4). Given the highly variable rates
of catch throughout the study period, we run scenarios that classify
March as either summer or winter to reflect the linkage between March
and the breeding state of penguins i.e.~Adélie and chinstrap penguins
have either migrated out of the area or have ceased to be centrally
foraging species by March.

Thus we reformulate the underlying assumptions above into a new model
construct, in which performance indices from gentoo, chinstrap and
Adélie penguins during the summer are included, but Adélie and chinstrap
penguins cease to be centrally foraging species after breeding and
migrate out of the area. The performance indices are matched in space
and time but using SSMU level estimates of LKB and LHR. We re-run the
model that includes imputed values for LKB in years where survey data
are missing. We further consider two alternatives for considering March,
either in a) summer or b) winter.

We present the outputs both in the same boxplot format as Figure 2 in
the original manuscript, and as individual cases grouped and
colour-coded as ONI ``warm'' (\(\geqslant\) 0.5; red), ONI ``neutral''
(-0.5 \textless{} ONI \textgreater{} +0.5; white) and ONI ``cold''
(\textless{} -0.5; blue). We also recreate the original marginal
probabilities in Table 1 of \citet{Watters2020}, and two additional
tables in the same format with the probabilities extracted from our
reformulated model, the difference between the latter two tables
reflecting whether March is in summer or winter.

\subsubsection{Results}\label{results}

From the original \citet{Watters2020} model, the probability that the
Worst Case would cause penguin performance indices to drop below their
long-term mean was 77\%, while relative to the Best Case there was a
93\% probability that penguin performance would decline as a response to
high LHR. Similarly, there was a 99\% probability that high LHR and LKB
under neutral ONI (``Worst Case'', though see above for comments on
this) would drive penguin peformance to fall below its long term mean
(Table 1).

Our reformulation displays a rather different picture, and while we
refrain from providing an exhaustive in-text comparison, we highlight a
few examples here. Comparing the original model outputs with ours,
relative to the ``Best Case'', the probability of negative impacts to
penguins due to high LHR dropped precipitously from \(\geqslant\) 93\%
to 37\% (Table 3). In other words, when considering the migration of
penguins in accordance with their known ecology (Figure 2), the relative
probability of negative impact of LHR drops from a near-certainty to
1-in-3 (Table 2 and 3). Given the temporal separation between fishing
and penguin breeding over the preceding decade, our results are
unsurprising.

The probability that the effects of warm or neutral ONI would be more
detrimental to penguin performance were greater than for the Worst Case
(Table 2 and 3). When we consider the marginal effects of neutral ONI
and high LHR, the probabilities that the former would negatively impact
penguin performance below the long-term mean was 4 times greater than
the impact of high LHR (Table 2 and 3). Looking at the case-by-case and
selected plots in Figure 4 the overwhelming dominace of the ONI state
can clearly be seen. La Niña (``cold'' ONI) conditions resulted in
predictive probabilities of performance that were equal to, or
surpassing, those of the Best Case irrespective of increased LKB or LHR.
Even more counterintuitively, an increase in LHR to even high levels has
a lower probability of decreasing penguin performance than that of the
Best Case (Table 2 and 3). However, it is important to note that overall
our intention is not to suggest that increased fishing is beneficial;
merely that when the model is reconditioned on ecological knowledge, the
outputs in its current formulation should be treated with caution.

In summary, Watters et al.~(2020) believe that penguins are responding
to both the environment and fishing. We agree that penguins are
responding to the environmental changes, however we believe that the
fishery effect is flawed because the scales at which their model
incorporates fishing bear no relevance to the scales at which penguins
exploit (Figure S1). The penguin performance in the orginal model was
also insensitive to marginal changes in LKB whichc corroborate previous
failed attempts to parameterise functional responses of penguins. This
insensitivity is in line with our results, but we propose that even the
SSMU scale is inappropriate for matching food availability and
harvesting pressure to predator performance (Figure S1).

In light of these findings, and the scales of management originally
proposed by us in WG-EMM 2019/18, we support the direction of
discussions during WG-ASAM this year to consider spatial scales of
management to areas in which the fishery operates, rather than at the
Subarea level.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our preliminary review of the evidence supporting localised effects of
fishing coupled with broad-scale climactic phenomena having an impact on
the vital statistics of pygoscelid penguins (performance and abundance
trends) are based on assumptions that potentially do not reflect current
knowledge of penguin breeding phenology and movement.

Of greatest concern, however, is that the interpretation of model
outputs from both approaches (either from both the original studies or
the modified parameters we describe) are under boundary conditions that
we feel are not appropriate. Both approaches consider only the fishery
and broad-scale climate phenomena as the only two causes of krill
abundance variability at geographic scales relevant to penguins. Neither
study considers, for example, the impact of rebounding baleen whale
populations or migratory male Antarctic fur seals beyond brief
mentioning. Humpback whales have increased in abundance throughout the
life of the krill fishery, and there are sufficient telemetry and
distance sampling studies in the scientific literature to demonstrate
the degree and significance of spatiotemporal overlap with breeding
penguin populations (see \citet{Santora2013}, \citet{Lowther2020},
Oosthuizen et al., Johannessen et al., Lowther et al.~submitted to this
meeting, and Figure S2 as examples). Importantly, the distribution of
these and numerous other unconsidered competitors is not uniform in
either space or time, and their impact on local availability of krill is
likely to be considerable. It is also worth noting that neither study
considers the impact of climate on the terrestrial breeding grounds,
such as chick mortality through ``wetting down'' by increased rainfall
\citep{chapmanMarineTerrestrialFactors2011}.

Similarly, the utilisation of broad-scale climatological phenomena to
characterise impacts at scales that predators are dependent upon is
problematic. The Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is the dominant climate feature
for the western Antarctic Peninsula. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation
modulates the ASL, with El Niño (La Niña) shallowing (deepening) its
pressure, causing more northwesterly (southeasterly) winds and upwelling
(restricted influx) of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the shelf. The
Southern Annular Mode also influences the pressure of the ASL, with the
current trend of negative SAM constructively (destructively) interfering
with ASL when in phase with El Niño (La Niña) events (e.g.
\citet{Clem2016}). The result is a set of above-surface climate
conditions that drive changes in water mass intrusion that is in turn
dependent on \emph{interactions} between two climate processes. The
bathymetry of the Antarctic Peninsula which also influences the
hydrographic conditions is complex (particularly at scales that are
important to centrally-foraging predators such as penguins) and the
structuring of krill aggregations in time and space in the WAP have been
linked to mesoscale circulation processes
\citep{santoraKrillSpaceComparative2012}, which are unlikely to be
uniformly affected by macroscale processes.

Our work into the future will progress along three lines, and we welcome
any and all offers of collaboration into this work. Firstly, we will
progress this debate into the scientific literature in order to ensure a
balanced discussion occurs in that forum. Secondly, we will be examining
in further detail some of the additional predictors used and their
efficacy, the modelling frameworks into which they are brought, and how
their incorporation influences the interpretation of the responses.
Finally, we shall also be exploring alternative modelling approaches
that reflect more of the physical and biological complexity of the
system in question. In all cases, our goal is to ensure that the best
available objective scientific evidence is presented to our
environmental managers and, where appropriate, flag that disagreement
exists. Our paper is intended to be viewed in this light to generate
constructive dialogue that addresses our common concern of the potential
for localised fishing to impact dependent aspects of the ecosystem.

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./Watters EMM figures/summer catch/Year by year catch} \caption{C1 Catch and Effort data for 2010 - 2018, for all catches during the period of the austral summer relating to Adélie and chinstrap penguins in Subarea 48.1 (i.e. up to $10^{th}$ March).  The telemetry data presented in Hinke et al. 2017 for chinstrap penguins at both Cape Shireff and Copacabana and the gSSMU used in the Watters et al. 2020 paper are superimposed to highlight the extreme variability in actual catch, relative to the scale of LHR used to reflect interactions with penguins.  Our reanalysis re-scaled LHR to the SSMU level, though we contend that for the purposes of matching predator data at appropriate spatial scales even this is too coarse a resolution.}\label{fig:Supplementary Figure 1}

\caption{The summer distribution of foraging effort by A) adult female Antarctic fur seals (adapted from telemetry data available in Hinke et al. 2017), B) migratory adult male Antarctic fur seals (adapted from Lowther et al. 2020) C) humpback whales throughout December (adapted from Johannessen et al., this meeting) and D) nonbreeding adult Adélie penguins during the breeding season (adapted from data in Oosthuizen et al., this meeting). Potential effects of competitive overlap between pygoscelid penguins and other krill dependent predators, particularly those who have increased their abundance dramatically over the preceding 40 years, are excluded from both approaches, creating an unrealistic set of boundary conditions for interpreting the variance in penguin vital rates.}\label{fig:Supplementary Figure 2 other species plots}
